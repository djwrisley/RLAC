This folder contains an R Notebook that will allow you to work with texts from Project Gutenberg using the Stylo package
with ease. The notebook pulls the texts from Project Gutenberg, cleans off the boilerplate, renames the files and 
places them in the proper folder structure for use with the `stylo` package.
