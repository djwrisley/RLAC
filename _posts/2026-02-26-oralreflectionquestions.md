## Overview - DRAFT

I have curated here a number of possible oral exam questions that would be relevant for the middle of the term in this class.  

## Format of the Oral Exam 

The oral exams will cover readings, material covered in your assignments and any material more generally in the class. 

The oral exam will take place in person in my faculty office in A6 1151. Everyone has signed up for a time to have their exam. It will last a maximum of 15 minutes (expect a little less) and the door to my office will be left open. It will be a face-to-face conversation. There are 10 minutes between each of the oral exams of downtime for me. Please be on time, but refrain from being too early and standing outside the door. 

## Rationale behind having an Oral Exam

- to put the course skills in a larger context
- to give students an opportunity to synthesize course materials periodically
- to use terms from the course correctly in academic conversation
- to see if you are able to revise or deepen an answer when prompted to go beyond an initial answer 
- to demonstrate metacognitive and reflective thinking ("I know this, but I'm not sure about...")
- to demonstrate awareness of course interests outside of the class, in a spoken register

## Questions about the Course Materials

- Which reading was your favorite reading? your least favorite? 
- What's one argument from the readings you disagree with? 
- Which reading made the greatest impression on you? 
- Which genre of material do you like the best (podcast, essay, digital project)?

## Questions about the Tools

- What new technical skills have you been exposed to? 
- Which tools have been the most helpful? which is the least helpful? 
- Which tools do you imagine you will use / forget after the course is over? 
- Which element of the tools presented in the course are challenging to understand? 

## Questions about Individual Assignments

- How did you choose the texts that you worked with? 
- How did your assignment change as you worked on it? 
- What did you learn about the topci of your assignment that you didn't know before? 
- What would be different if you had chosen more texts or fewer?
- If you had had more time for your assignment what would you have done differently?

## Terms from the Class 

- distant reading, close reading, surface reading, computational thinking, static sites, distant coding, Markdown, GitHub, Voyant Tools, wordclouds, data visualization, text editor, corpus, tidyverse, stopwords, R package

## Questions about the Class

- What are you learning from this class that you have never been exposed to before? 
- What are you not sure about in the class that you would like to dive deeper into? 
- How do the materials of the class relate to your experiences? 
- What subject of the class have you told your friends about?


Once you have completed your oral exam, there is nothing else that you need to do. 

Good luck on your oral exam!
