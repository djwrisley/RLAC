## Assignment 1: Text Analysis with a Computational Tool

### Overview

In this assignment, you will select a text corpus and use a computational text analysis tool to explore it, generate insights, and communicate your findings to an audience.

**Due Date:** Friday, May 1, 2026  
**Submission Format:** Web-based (on your course website)  
**Length:** ~1,500 words + visualizations  
**Value:** 15% of your final grade

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:

1. Apply a computational text analysis tool to a real-world corpus
2. Generate and interpret visualizations and quantitative results
3. Ground computational findings in humanistic analysis
4. Communicate technical work to a non-specialist audience
5. Critically evaluate the affordances and limitations of computational methods

## Assignment Description

### Part 1: Selection and Framing (300 words)

Choose a corpus of texts that interests you and articulate a research question or analytical goal. Your corpus could be:

**Suggested Corpora:**
- A collection of literary texts (e.g., short stories, poems, novels by a single author)
- News articles on a particular topic or from a specific publication
- Social media posts, tweets, or blog posts
- Historical documents or letters
- Song lyrics, movie scripts, or other cultural texts
- Your own dataset (with instructor approval)

**Your Framing Should:**
- Describe the corpus (what texts? how many? what time period?)
- Explain why you chose this corpus
- Articulate 2-3 research questions you want to explore
- Indicate what you hope to discover through computational analysis
- Explain why a computational approach is useful for your questions

### Part 2: Computational Analysis (600 words)

Conduct your analysis using one or more of the tools we've explored in class:

**Tool Options:**
- **Voyant Tools** — Web-based visualization and analysis
- **AntConc** — Corpus analysis software
- **R/RStudio** — Statistical text analysis
- **Python** — With libraries like NLTK or spaCy
- Other tools (with instructor approval)

**Your Analysis Should:**
- Clearly explain which tool(s) you used and why
- Describe the analysis process you followed
- Present 3-5 key findings or patterns you discovered
- Include 3-5 visualizations (screenshots, graphs, word clouds, etc.)
- Explain what each visualization shows and what it means

**Examples of Analysis Approaches:**
- Frequency analysis: Which words appear most often? How do frequencies change over time?
- Comparative analysis: How do different texts or corpora differ in their word use?
- Pattern finding: What clusters or groupings emerge from the data?
- Sentiment analysis: What emotional tones or attitudes appear in the texts?
- Stylistic analysis: How do different authors or texts differ stylistically?

### Part 3: Critical Interpretation (500 words)

Reflect on what your computational analysis reveals and its limitations.

**Address:**
- What do your results suggest about the corpus? What is interesting or surprising?
- How do these findings relate to your research questions?
- What humanistic knowledge or context helps interpret these results?
- What are the limitations of your analysis? (corpus bias, tool limitations, etc.)
- What biases or assumptions might be embedded in the tool you used?
- What questions remain unanswered? What would you explore next?

**Tone:** Thoughtful, critical, and honest about what you don't know

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I use a corpus I found online?**  
A: Yes, as long as it's legally and ethically available. Avoid copyright-protected texts without permission.

**Q: What if the tool doesn't work as I expected?**  
A: That's valuable information! Document what happened, explain what you learned, and discuss it in your critical section. Tool challenges are learning opportunities.

**Q: Can I use a tool that's not on the suggested list?**  
A: Yes, but get instructor approval first. Bring an example or link to class.

**Q: How many visualizations do I need?**  
A: At least 3, no more than 5. Quality over quantity.

**Q: Can I work with a partner?**  
A: No, assignments must be individual work. You may discuss ideas, but writing and analysis must be your own.
