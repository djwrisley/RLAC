## Assignment 2: Remediation and Analysis of Digitized Texts

### Overview

In this assignment, you will work with a corpus that exists in a non-textual or difficult-to-parse form (handwritten documents, scanned PDFs, audio files, etc.), remediate it into digital text through OCR, HTR, or transcription, and then analyze the resulting corpus using computational methods.

**Due Date:** Friday, May 23, 2026  
**Submission Format:** Web-based (on your course website)  
**Length:** ~1,500 words + visualizations + digital artifacts  
**Value:** 15% of your final grade

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:

1. Understand the process and challenges of converting non-textual sources into machine-readable text
2. Apply OCR, HTR, or transcription technologies to real-world materials
3. Critically evaluate the accuracy and limitations of automated digitization
4. Analyze the remediated corpus to explore how the digitization process affects your findings
5. Reflect on the ethics and implications of digitizing cultural materials

## Assignment Description

### Part 1: Source Selection and Digitization Strategy (400 words)

Select a source material that exists in a non-textual or difficult-to-parse format:

**Source Options:**
- **Handwritten materials** — Letters, diaries, manuscripts, notes
- **Scanned PDFs** — Books, academic papers, historical documents
- **Audio or video** — Podcasts, interviews, recorded lectures, performance recordings
- **Images of text** — Photographs of documents, street signs, graffiti
- **Your own materials** — With instructor approval

**Your Section Should:**
- Describe the source material and its significance
- Explain why this corpus is interesting or important to analyze
- Describe the remediation method(s) you will use:
  - OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for scanned documents
  - HTR (Handwritten Text Recognition) for manuscripts
  - Transcription for audio/video materials
  - Manual digitization
- Articulate your digitization strategy and tools
- Note any copyright or ethical considerations

**Tool Options for Digitization:**
- **OCR:** Google Docs OCR, Tesseract, Adobe Acrobat
- **HTR:** Transkribus, Google Cloud Vision, manual transcription
- **Audio Transcription:** Otter.ai, Google Speech-to-Text, Rev, manual transcription
- **Video Transcription:** YouTube auto-captions, Descript, manual transcription

### Part 2: Remediation Process and Critical Analysis (600 words)

Document and analyze your digitization process.

**Your Section Should Include:**
- Screenshots or examples showing the original source material
- Description of the digitization process you followed
- Examples of the digitized text output
- Discussion of accuracy and errors:
  - What did the tool handle well?
  - What were the errors or limitations?
  - How much manual correction was needed?
  - How might these errors affect computational analysis?
- Comparison of tool performance (if testing multiple tools)
- Reflection on the labor involved in digitization
- Consideration of how different people might digitize the same material differently

**Critical Questions to Address:**
- Does the digitized version capture what was important about the original?
- What is lost in the remediation process?
- Who controls the digitization process and how might that shape what gets preserved?
- What biases might the tool introduce? (e.g., language, handwriting styles, accents)

### Part 3: Computational Analysis (400 words)

Analyze the remediated corpus using computational methods.

**Your Analysis Should:**
- Apply computational methods to the digitized text
- Present 3-5 key findings through visualizations and text
- Reflect on how the digitization process may have affected your results
- Compare findings from the remediated text to what you notice in the original material
- Discuss what is revealed through computational analysis that might not be visible through close reading alone

**Possible Analysis Approaches:**
- Frequency analysis of most common words or phrases
- Temporal patterns (if materials span a time period)
- Comparison with other corpora
- Sentiment or stylistic analysis
- Named entity recognition (identifying people, places, organizations)
- Topic modeling

### Part 4: Reflection on Technology and Digitization (300 words)

Conclude with critical reflection on the broader implications.

**Address:**
- What surprised you about the digitization process?
- How does understanding the "messy" process of digitization change how you think about digital texts?
- What are the ethics of digitizing and analyzing private or sensitive materials?
- How might digitization projects reflect power dynamics (who decides what gets digitized? how?)
- What would you do differently if you did this again?

## Ethical Considerations

Before beginning this project, consider:

- **Privacy:** Does digitizing this material raise privacy concerns? Do you have permission?
- **Copyright:** Is the material in the public domain or under copyright?
- **Representation:** Could this material be used in ways that harm the people it represents?
- **Context:** Are you removing important context by digitizing and abstracting the material?

If you have concerns about the ethical implications of your chosen source material, discuss with the instructor.

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I use materials from an archive or library?**  
A: Yes, but check copyright and permission requirements first. Academic use is often permitted, but verify.

**Q: What if the OCR/HTR accuracy is terrible?**  
A: Document and discuss this in your critical section. Tool limitations are important to understand. You may need to manually correct significant errors.

**Q: Can I transcribe audio/video instead of using OCR?**  
A: Yes, manual transcription is a valid approach, though it's labor-intensive. Note the time and effort involved.

**Q: How accurate does the remediated text need to be?**  
A: Aim for 85-95% accuracy for OCR. For HTR and transcription, do your best. Discuss any significant errors or remaining problems.

**Q: Can I work with a partner?**  
A: No, assignments must be individual work. You may discuss approaches, but the work must be your own.
