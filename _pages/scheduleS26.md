## Course Components

The semester is structured around two main pedagogical phases:

### Phase 1: Foundations in Digital Textual Analysis (Weeks 1-7)
Focus on understanding computational approaches to text and developing practical skills with tools and methods. Weekly classroom sessions combine lectures, discussions, guided exercises, and lab work.

### Phase 2: Project-Based Application (Weeks 8-15)  
Application of learned methods to new texts and contexts. Greater emphasis on independent work, student-directed projects, and peer learning. Lab sessions provide support and flexibility for diverse project approaches.

## Course Structure and Meeting Format

Classes are structured with the following components:

- **Synchronous sessions (TuTh 11:20-12:45)** — Lectures, discussions, workshops, and lab time
- **Asynchronous materials** — Recorded tutorials, readings, and supplementary resources posted online
- **Office hours (Tu 2:15-3:15 PM in person; Th 7-8 PM virtual)** — Individual consultation and project support

The course emphasizes active engagement and experimentation. Students are expected to attend classes regularly, participate in discussions, and engage with assigned materials and tools.
