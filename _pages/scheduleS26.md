## Spring 2026 Course Schedule

This schedule is organized by week. Reading and assignment details will be posted on the course site as we progress through the semester. All material is subject to change at the instructor's discretion based on our progress in the course. 

Materials: 

The course learning materials are composed of numerous online articles & tutorials, interdisciplinary writing from the web, videos, digital projects in addition to traditional academic readings.  **There will be no books for purchase.**  Students will have access to ebook chapters available through NYU Libraries. Readings & other materials will be listed here a few weeks in advance of the courses. 

For this course you will need to make some accounts and download some software. We will make use of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), as well as a number of web-based tools. You will also be assigned access to [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) within a few weeks.  If you are familiar with [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) and already have it downloaded, you can download the notebooks and use them on your own machine. For beginners, I recommend the cloud based version.  These resources are all at no cost to you.

## Course Components

The semester is structured around two main pedagogical phases:

### Phase 1: Foundations in Digital Textual Analysis (Weeks 1-7)
Focus on understanding computational approaches to text and developing practical skills with tools and methods. Weekly classroom sessions combine lectures, discussions, guided exercises, and lab work.

### Phase 2: Project-Based Application (Weeks 8-15)  
Application of learned methods to new texts and contexts. Greater emphasis on independent work, student-directed projects, and peer learning. Lab sessions provide support and flexibility for diverse project approaches.

## Course Structure and Meeting Format

Classes are structured with the following components:

- **Synchronous sessions (TuTh 11:20-12:45)** — Lectures, discussions, workshops, and lab time
- **Asynchronous materials** — Recorded tutorials, readings, and supplementary resources posted online
- **Office hours (Tu 2:15-3:15 PM in person; Th 7-8 PM virtual)** — Individual consultation and project support

The course emphasizes active engagement and experimentation. Students are expected to attend classes regularly, participate in discussions, and engage with assigned materials and tools.
