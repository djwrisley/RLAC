## Common Questions

**Q: Can I use a corpus someone else created?**  
A: Yes, but you must acknowledge the source and explain why you're using this particular corpus rather than creating your own.

**Q: How large does my corpus need to be?**  
A: 50–10,000 texts depending on your research questions. Discuss if you have questions.

**Q: What if my analysis doesn't find what I expected?**  
A: That's valuable! Negative results and unexpected findings are important in research. Discuss what you learned.

**Q: Can I use data I've collected myself?**  
A: Yes, with instructor approval. You may need to anonymize or de-identify personal data.

**Q: Can I work with a partner?**  
A: No, this is an individual project. However, you can discuss ideas and give peer feedback to classmates.

**Q: Can I use multiple methods or tools?**  
A: Absolutely! Using multiple complementary approaches often yields richer insights.
