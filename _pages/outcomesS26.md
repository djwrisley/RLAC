## Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will:

1. **Compare basic techniques of computer-assisted analysis of texts** — Understand different computational approaches to text analysis and when each is appropriate.

2. **Compare and contrast different forms of reading** — Analyze the relationships between human reading, non-human (computational) reading, and hybrid forms that combine both.

3. **Articulate computational thinking** — Develop an understanding of how computational approaches enable new ways of thinking about texts and problems, recognizing questions of bias and scale.

4. **Integrate visuals into analytical writing** — Develop skills in visual communication, using visualizations critically and with clarity to support written arguments.

5. **Practice effective communication in multiple formats** — Develop multimodal communication skills through written responses, web-based publishing, synchronous discussions.

6. **Debate possible futures of reading** — Engage in informed discussion about how technology might shape the future of reading, interpretation, and knowledge-making.

## Alignment with NYUAD Core Program Learning Outcomes

The course outcomes map to the following NYUAD Core Program Learning Outcomes:

### 1. Critical Inquiry and Analysis
Students will critically examine contemporary topics through:
- Qualitative analysis (close reading, interpretation)
- Quantitative methods (computational analysis, data visualization)  
- Contextual reasoning (historical, social, cultural contexts)
- Creative approaches (experimentation, novel applications of tools)

**Relevant Course Outcomes:** TBA

### 2. Communication and Expression
Students will communicate effectively for various audiences through:
- Public web-based writing
- Participation in synchronous discussions
- Recorded tutorials and multimedia formats
- Academic and non-academic writing styles

**Relevant Course Outcomes:** TBA

### 3. Self-Understanding and Intercultural Competency
Students will demonstrate awareness of:
- Their own assumptions about reading and interpretation
- Diverse perspectives on technology and data
- Global disparities in cultural representation

**Relevant Course Outcomes:** TBA

### 4. Conceptual and Ethical Complexity
Students will identify and reflect critically on:
- Ethical implications of computational analysis
- Limitations and possibilities of algorithms
- Power dynamics in data collection and interpretation

**Relevant Course Outcomes:** TBA
