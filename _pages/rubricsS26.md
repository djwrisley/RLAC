## Written Response Rubric

| Criterion | Exemplary (10) | Proficient (8) | Developing (6) | Beginning (4) | Incomplete (0) |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Central Idea/Argument** | Clear, focused argument that directly engages course concepts; original thinking evident | Clear argument that engages course concepts with mostly original thinking | Argument present but somewhat unclear; relies heavily on course materials | Argument vague or superficial; minimal engagement with concepts | No clear argument or engagement |
| **Evidence & Analysis** | Strong, specific evidence; sophisticated analysis showing critical thinking | Good evidence; clear analysis connecting to argument | Adequate evidence; basic analysis present | Limited or generic evidence; minimal analysis | Missing evidence or analysis |
| **Visual Integration** | Visuals are essential to argument; multiple, well-chosen, clearly captioned; professional quality | Visuals support argument; well-chosen, clearly captioned | Some visuals present; captions present but could be clearer | Visuals present but minimally integrated; weak captions | Few/no visuals or poorly integrated |
| **Writing Quality** | Exceptional clarity and style; sophisticated vocabulary; error-free | Clear, well-organized; good word choice; minimal errors | Generally clear; some organizational issues; minor errors | Unclear in places; organizational problems; multiple errors | Poor clarity and organization; numerous errors |

|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Method Selection & Application** | Method(s) thoughtfully chosen and expertly applied; clear rationale; sophisticated use of tools | Method(s) appropriate and correctly applied; clear purpose; good use of tools | Method(s) appropriate but application could be stronger; adequate tool use | Method(s) chosen but misapplied; limited tool mastery; unclear purpose | Methods missing or fundamentally misapplied |
| **Research Question & Design** | Compelling question; rigorous research design; demonstrates computational thinking | Good question; sound research design; shows computational thinking | Adequate question; basic research design; some computational thinking | Vague question; weak design; limited computational thinking | Missing or incoherent research design |
| **Analysis & Results** | Results clearly presented and thoroughly analyzed; multiple perspectives considered | Results clearly presented; solid analysis; most aspects addressed | Results presented; basic analysis; some gaps | Results presented but weakly analyzed | Missing or unclear results |
| **Critical Evaluation** | Sophisticated discussion of findings, limitations, biases, implications | Good discussion of findings and limitations; considers some implications | Adequate discussion; acknowledges some limitations | Limited discussion; few limitations acknowledged | No critical evaluation |
| **Visual Communication** | Multiple, sophisticated visualizations; all clearly explained; essential to argument | Clear, well-designed visualizations; appropriately explained | Visualizations present; mostly clear; explanation adequate | Visualizations present but unclear or poorly explained | Few/no visualizations or incomprehensible |
| **Writing Quality & Organization** | Exceptional clarity, flow, and organization; sophisticated voice; minimal errors | Clear organization and flow; appropriate scholarly voice; minor errors | Generally organized; mostly clear; some awkward passages; minor errors | Organization could be clearer; writing needs improvement; several errors | Disorganized; unclear writing; numerous errors |

|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Research Question & Corpus** | Compelling, well-defined question; appropriate and well-described corpus; clear significance | Good question; appropriate corpus; clear purpose | Adequate question; corpus appropriate though description could be stronger | Vague question; corpus adequate but could be better justified | Missing or unclear question/corpus |
| **Method & Analysis** | Sophisticated, multi-method analysis; demonstrates mastery of course concepts; insightful findings | Sound analysis using appropriate methods; good application of concepts; meaningful findings | Adequate analysis with acceptable methods; shows understanding of concepts | Basic analysis; limited methodological sophistication; marginal findings | Weak or missing analysis |
| **Critical Thinking & Limitations** | Nuanced discussion of findings, assumptions, limitations, and implications; acknowledges uncertainty | Discusses findings, limitations, and implications; mostly thorough | Acknowledges some limitations and implications; could be more thorough | Limited discussion of limitations; implications unclear | No critical evaluation |
| **Visualization & Presentation** | Exceptional digital components; visuals are sophisticated, informative, and elegant; presentation is engaging | Good visualizations and digital components; clear presentation; well-organized | Adequate visualizations; presentation is clear but could be more engaging | Basic visualizations; presentation adequate but could be improved | Poor or missing visualizations/presentation |
| **Writing Quality** | Excellent clarity, organization, and scholarly voice; sophisticated argument; minimal errors | Clear writing; good organization; appropriate voice; minor errors | Generally clear; acceptable organization; some awkward passages | Clarity issues; organization could improve; several errors | Poor writing quality; unclear organization; numerous errors |
| **Originality & Creativity** | Highly original approach; creative application of methods; demonstrates independent thinking | Original perspective; creative elements present; shows independent thinking | Some originality; mostly follows standard approaches; adequate creativity | Limited originality; mostly follows standard approaches | Derivative; shows little independent thinking |
