## Written Response Guidelines

### Overview

Throughout the semester, you will write 4 responses that demonstrate your engagement with course concepts and your developing skills in digital textual analysis. These responses should integrate written reflection with visual elements to communicate your ideas effectively.

---

## Purpose

Written responses serve multiple purposes in this course:

1. **Reflection** — Think critically about concepts discussed in class
2. **Application** — Apply course methods to new texts or contexts  
3. **Communication** — Develop your voice as a public scholar
4. **Documentation** — Create a record of your learning journey

---

## Response Types

Responses can take different forms depending on the assignment prompt:

### Conceptual Response
Reflects on theoretical ideas, course themes, or readings. Engages with philosophical or methodological questions raised in class.

### Lab Report / Experiment Documentation
Documents a computational analysis or tool experimentation you've conducted. Includes:
- Research question or goal
- Method and tools used
- Results and visualizations
- Critical analysis of findings and limitations

### Case Study
Applies course concepts to analyze a specific text, corpus, or cultural phenomenon. Shows how computational thinking illuminates a particular problem.

### Tool or Method Critique
Evaluates a specific technology, tool, or methodology discussed in class. Considers:
- What it does well
- Limitations or potential biases
- When and why you might use it
- Broader implications

## Format and Structure

### Length
- 750–1,000 words (plus visuals)
- Quality matters more than strict word count

### Visual Elements (Required)
Each response must include well-chosen visual elements:
- Screenshots of computational analysis results
- Data visualizations or charts
- Images of texts or corpora you're analyzing
- Diagrams or concept maps
- Photographs or other relevant media

Use visuals to *support and clarify* your written argument, not just as decoration. Every visual should be captioned and referenced in your text.

### Structure

**Opening (100-150 words)**
- Clearly state your main idea or research question
- Establish why this topic matters
- Give context for your analysis

**Body (400-600 words)**
- Develop your argument with evidence
- Incorporate visuals at key points
- Use clear topic sentences
- Show your thinking process

**Closing (100-150 words)**
- Synthesize your findings
- Reflect on what you've learned
- Consider implications or future directions
- Note any limitations of your analysis

---

## Writing Style

These responses should be **accessible, engaging academic writing** suitable for a public audience:

- **Clear and direct** — Avoid jargon; explain technical terms when necessary
- **Active voice** — Prefer "I analyzed..." to "An analysis was conducted..."
- **Concrete examples** — Ground your points in specific evidence
- **Critical perspective** — Question, evaluate, and reflect; don't just summarize
- **Honest about limitations** — Acknowledge what you don't know or what's uncertain

---

## Technical Requirements

### Format
- HTML, Markdown, Google Docs, or other web-publishable format
- Clean, readable layout with clear headings
- Consistent formatting and styling

### Publishing
- Post responses to your course website/blog
- Include date and response number
- Make sure all links and images work correctly
- Provide a link to the response from a main index or syllabus page

### Citation
- Cite any sources you reference (readings, tutorials, tools, data sources)
- Use Chicago, MLA, or APA style consistently
- For images/visuals: include source attribution or note if original
